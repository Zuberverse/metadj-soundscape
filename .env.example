# Proxy controls
# The proxy is disabled by default in production for security.
# Enable with SCOPE_PROXY_ENABLE=true only when your deployment has proper
# access controls (Vercel Password Protection, VPN, etc.).
# Production writes are limited to same-origin browser requests and
# endpoint/method allowlisted Scope operations.
SCOPE_PROXY_ENABLE=false

# Optional: add a server-side write token requirement for production write operations.
# When set, clients must send the token using SCOPE_PROXY_WRITE_TOKEN_HEADER.

# Optional: forwarded-IP trust controls for rate limiting.
# Keep false in production unless your platform sanitizes forwarding headers.
