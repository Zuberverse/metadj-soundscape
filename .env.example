# Proxy controls
# The proxy is disabled by default in production for security.

# access controls (Vercel Password Protection, VPN, etc.).
# Production writes are limited to same-origin browser requests and
# endpoint/method allowlisted Scope operations.

# - By default, production write operations require a server-side token.
# - Set SCOPE_PROXY_REQUIRE_WRITE_TOKEN=false only for tightly controlled private deployments.
